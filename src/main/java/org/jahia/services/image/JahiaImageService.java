     * image ratio and scale the image both horizontally and vertically to match the specified width
     * and height. This will usually result in a deformed image and is usually not recommended.
     * - ResizeType.ADJUST_SIZE : in this algorithm the width and height are more considered as
     * desired sizes, but they will be modified to fit the aspect ratio of the original image. Note that
     * the width and height will never be exceeded, so the resulting image will always be smaller than
     * the specified one.
     * - ResizeType.ASPECT_FILL : in this case the resulting image will have the exact specified size,
     * and the image will be resized and cropped (using the center gravity crop) to fill the desired
     * dimension. This will result in some of the image to be removed, but is usually acceptable for
     * profile or icons.
     * - ResizeType.ASPECT_FIT : in this last algorithm the desired image will have the exact specified
     * size and the original image ratio is conserved, but borders will be added to the image to make
     * it match the desired size.
     * @param i the image to resize
     * @param outputFile the file in which to output the resized image
     * @param width the width of the resized image
     * @param height the height of the resized image
     * @param resizeType the type of resize algorithm to use. Uses a ResizeType enum also available
     * in this interface
     * @return true if the resize succeeded, false otherwise.
