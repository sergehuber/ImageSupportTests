This small utility makes it easy to check for supports of Java 2D on headless systems, as well as compare
performance of image generation using three libraries :

- Java2D
- Thumbnailator, http://code.google.com/p/thumbnailator/
- Im4Java, http://im4java.sourceforge.net/

You can generate the project using : 

  mvn clean install assembly:single

and then run using : 

  java -jar target/ImageSupportTests-*.jar

which will show you the command line syntax 

Here is an example output from the tool :

> java -jar ImageSupportTests-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar logo-acme.png
VM supported read image types = image/png,image/jpeg,image/x-png,image/vnd.wap.wbmp,image/gif,image/bmp
VM supported write image types = image/png,image/jpeg,image/x-png,image/vnd.wap.wbmp,image/bmp,image/gif
Warming up Java VM with 100 warmup loops...
Testing and benchmarking image generation (100 loops each, resizing to 160x160)...
Accumulated time for Thumbnailator default quality=1345ms, average=13.45ms
